# Radiation-Level-Prediction

Predict Solar Radiation Level using Machine Learning models and analyze how various factors like temperature, wind speed, humidity and pressure are affecting the solar radiation level, so that we can minimize the impact for betterment of mankind. 

Solar radiation is the Earth's primary source of energy and has an important role in the surface radiation balance, hydrological cycles, vegetation photosynthesis, and weather and climate extremes. The accurate prediction of solar radiation is therefore very important in both the solar industry and climate research.

This project predicts the Solar Radiation Level using Linear     Regression, Decision Tree, and  Random Forest Models using the “Solar Radiation” Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 11 variables like wind direction, wind speed, humidity, and temperature and 32686 instances in total to predict the target variable “Radiation.” The dataset is meteorological data from the HI-SEAS weather station from September 2016 to December 2016, between Mission IV and V.
